{"content":[{"title":"iPhone X : Review",
  "article":"Welcome to my ongoing impressions of the iPhone X. I've entered my third full day with the phone. Day 2 was mostly a blur of media hits, after a nearly sleepless night. Everything you're reading here is new as of the afternoon of Wednesday, November 1. I'm a pretty quick adopter of weird, new tech. The iPhone X isn't even that weird: it's really an evolved iPhone, with a sharp design and some new ways to use it. But I found, sure enough, that my first day with Apple's top-end phone was a learning process. Face ID and its log-in process. All the new swipes and gestures and button-presses. Learning to accept The Notch In The Screen.Apple itself is calling it the future of the smartphone, the embodiment of what it’s been trying to achieve for a decade. But while the iPhone X is all about premium parts and an all-new experience, it’s a huge gamble for the Cupertino brand too as it tries to reclaim some leadership in smartphone innovation.Losing key, reliable elements like the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, the home button; introducing new methods of navigating and unlocking the phone – and charging a lot more for the privilege – seems risky for a company that was already treading new ground by doing away with the traditional headphone jack last year.But the iPhone X is the handset we’ve been demanding from Apple for years – a world away from the increasingly-tired designs that those who just want a new iPhone have had to make do with.

 "title":"Galaxy S8 : Review",
 "article":"It’s been a few months since the Samsung Galaxy S8 hit shelves, and it’s fair to say it’s changes phones a bit. Since Samsung unleashed its 2017 flagships the edge-to-edge design it started has spread. Now the Google Pixel 2 XL, iPhone X, LG V30 and Huawei Mate 10 Pro have it. But is the S8 still king?But back to how Samsung has designed the Galaxy S8… it's just pure premium from start to finish. The way the front and back of the phone roll into the metal rim that sits around the outside of the phone is simply exquisite, and there's a real pleasure to be had when just rolling this phone around and around in your palm.It's worth noting here that we have heard reports of the Samsung Galaxy S8 proving to be a big fragile when dropped, but it's not something we noticed in our testing. Looking around the reports, it seems that the rear glass is more prone to dropping, but it's hard to tell if the instances are higher than usual or this is just a more popular phone.The key thing is that it's glass front and back with less structural support than other devices, so if you're worried there are some good cases to check out.",
